# Field Services

The `gizmo` tool provides certain services related to a robotics
competition field.  These services include field location as well as
control signal transmission.  The control services provide all the
abstraction for a Logitech F310 gamepad to be made available over the
network with 50Hz update frequency.

There are multiple flavors of field services, consult the different
pages in this section to find the most appropriate section.
