# Welcome to Gizmo!

Welcome to the Gizmo robotics platform.  This open source hardware and
software ecosystem will enable you to build advanced mechatronics
systems.  You don't need to be an expert to build something impressive!

This guide will walk you through what the various components of the
Gizmo ecosystem are, how to use them, and a getting started experience
in a variety of languages.  While we recommend you sit down and read
all of the getting started information as a single unit, each section
can be consulted standalone for quick reference.
