# Welcome to Gizmo!

Welcome to the Gizmo robotics platform.  This open source hardware and
software ecosystem will enable you to build advanced mechatronics
systems.  You don't need to be an expert to build something impressive!

This guide will walk you through what the various components of the
Gizmo ecosystem are, how to use them, and a getting started experience
in a variety of languages.  While we recommend you sit down and read
all of the getting started information as a single unit, each section
can be consulted standalone for quick reference.

## Document Conventions

Throughout this manual we'll use certain document conventions to
signal different information.

> [!NOTE]
>
> This is a note, it has information in it that may give you more
> context or help you understand a concept better.

> [!WARNING]
>
> This is a warning, and as you might expect, it warns you from
> something you probably don't want to happen.

> [!TIP]
>
> This is a tip.  It contains advanced information or a quicker way of
> doing things, but may not be as easy to grasp as the alternatives
> presented around it.

This is a code block.  We'll use these when we want to show you
programs or source code.  In those cases, the code will have colors to
make it easier to read.
```

This is a command example.  You can tell its a command because we've
put a `$` and its shown in a special monospace font to match the one
in your PowerShell or terminal window.  Do not type the `$`, it is
shown only to make clear the beginning of the command.

```
$ .\gizmo.exe
```

This is a menu reference.  We'll use this formatting to show you a
path through a context menu to a particular option.  Each item between
the '>' characters is one item in the menu that you can mouse over to
access the next layer.  The final item is the one you click on.
