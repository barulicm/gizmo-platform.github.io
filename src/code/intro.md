# Programming the Gizmo

The Gizmo is part of a mechatronics platform.  This means it combines
electronics and mechanical systems.  While there are a lot of clever
things you can do with pure electronics, most systems in modern times
will include a programmable microcontroller to allow for advanced
functionality that would be cumbersome to implement entirely in
hardware.  The Gizmo is no different and includes a processor
dedicated to running user programs.

This section will provide an overview of the various languages and
options available for programming the Gizmo.  If you don't want to
write your own programs, a selection of example code is available for
the Arduino environment which can get you quickly up and running with
a default configuration.
