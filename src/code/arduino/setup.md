# Setup

Programming with the Arduino environment will require the Arduino IDE
to be installed and configured.  Fortunately, if you have already
followed the steps in [Prerequisites](/startup/prereq.md) this is
already done.

If you have not yet completed the prerequisites, or did so on a
different computer, consult those sections for how to get started.
