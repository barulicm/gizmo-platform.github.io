# Learning Resources

In this section we'll dive into what the Gizmo is, how it works, and
how it was built.  You'll find links to further reading, video
resources, and discussions into how the entire Gizmo platform works
together.

You don't have to understand or even read this section to be able to
use the Gizmo, but it will help you gain an understanding of how all
the parts fit together and the design rational that led to the
development of the Gizmo platform.
